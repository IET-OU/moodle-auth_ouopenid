    <h1> John Horlock </h1>
    <p> John Horlock served as Vice-Chancellor at The Open University from
1981 to 1990. John Horlock was born in 1928 in North London, and went to
school at Edmonton Latymer. In an interview in the New Scientist to mark
his appointment as OU Vice-Chancellor he says 'My family is best
described as lower middle-class, with no engineering history in it.' In
the interview he explains that he had decided on an engineering
apprenticeship at Shorts, Rochester but his Headmaster instead persuaded
him to go to Cambridge University, where he gained a first in mechanical
sciences. Horlock worked briefly at Rolls-Royce before returning to
Cambridge to gain a PhD. Horlock turned down an offer to return to
Rolls-Royce: 'I was concerned that I would be spending most of my time on
military applications.'
    <p> In 1958 Horlock left Cambridge to become Professor and Head of the
Mechanical Engineering Department of Liverpool University, returning to
Cambridge as Professor of Engineering in 1967. In both roles he is
credited with educational innovations to improved both research and
teaching. His academic work on gas turbines, compressors and the jet
engine made him a leading figure in a field which transformed transport
across the world. In 1974 Horlock became Vice-Chancellor of the
University of Salford, which had become a University only in 1967 and
made major progress under his leadership.
    <p> Horlock joined the Open University in 1981. His commitment in the
field of continuing education, particularly in science and technology was
seen as one of the factors leading to his appointment. As a member of the
Finniston Committee looking at the engineering profession he was very
keen to strengthen the OU in science and engineering. As well as leading
the battle against the government over funding cuts, Horlock also ensured
the introduction of a taught postgraduate masters programme, oversaw the
opening of the Open Business School  and the expansion of the OU into
Western Europe. After retiring from the OU, Horlock was appointed
Treasurer and Vice-President of The Royal Society for five years and was
knighted for services to science, engineering and education in 1996. He
lives not far from The Open University.
    <p> The Horlock building on the Walton Hall campus was opened in opened
in 1989. It houses the Faculty of Health and Social Care. Sir John was
interviewed for the Oral History Project in 2009. Below is an extract
from that interview. A video clip of Sir John addressing OUSA conference
is available as part of Funding cuts: the fight back.

    <h1> Walter Perry </h1>
    <p> Walter Perry (1921-2003) was the first Vice-Chancellor of the
Open University from 1969 to 1979 and one of its key architects.
He was made a Fellow of the University in 1981.
    <p> Harold Wilson, who as Prime Minister created the Open University,
described Walter Perry as ‘the man who has done more than anyone to
ensure the success of what is now recognised in Britain, and in the wider
world, as one of the most important educational and social developments
of this century.’
    <p> Walter Laing MacDonald Perry was born in Dundee on 16 June 1921, to
Fletcher Perry and Flora MacDonald. He was educated at Ayr Academy,
Dundee High School, and the University of St. Andrews, where he gained
MB, ChB (1943), MD (1948) and DSc (1958).
    <p> He began his career as Medical Officer in Colonial Services
(Nigeria), 1944-1946, and then for the RAF, 1946-1947. Between 1947 and
1952 he was a member of staff for the Medical Research Council and then
became Director of the Department of Biological Standards at the National
Institute for Medical Research (1952-1958). In 1958 he was appointed
Professor of Pharmacology at University of Edinburgh and its
Vice-Principal from 1967 to 1968, until he took on the role of
Vice-Chancellor at the Open University in 1969.
    <p> In 1960 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (Edinburgh). In
1963, he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians (Edinburgh),
in 1967 a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (Edinburgh), and in
1978 a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1985 he was made a
Fellow of the Royal Society.
    <p> As well as his educational work Walter Perry was the Chairman of
Community Radio Milton Keynes from 1979 to 1982, Chairman of Living Tapes
Ltd from 1980, Chairman of Videotel Marine International from 1985 to
1998 and President of the Company from 1998 onwards. He was Deputy Leader
of the SDP in the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983.
    <p> Walter Perry received several honorary degrees and has been involved
in various societies and commissions, many educational. He was awarded an
OBE in 1957, a knighthood in 1974 and was created a Life Peer in 1979,
taking as his title Baron Perry of Walton. In 1994 he was awarded the
Wellcome Gold Medal and in 2000 he was awarded the Royal medal from the RSE.
    <p> Walter Perry was married twice; first to Anne Elizabeth Grant from
1946 to 1971 with whom he had three sons, Michael, Alan and Niall; and
second to Catharine Hilda Crawley from 1971, with whom he has two sons
and one daughter, Robin, Colin and Jennifer. He died in 2003 in Edinburgh.
    <p> Walter Perry was instrumental in setting up The Open University as it
is known today. His book, Open University, A personal account by the
first Vice-Chancellor, provides a wealth of information about how this
was done. Information about his influence as Vice-Chancellor is spread
throughout this website, particularly in the 1969-1979 section.
    <p> The Walter Perry Collection is housed in The Open University Archive.
It comprises papers relating to the University’s creation, Perry’s work
as Vice-Chancellor and papers relating to the many projects and
initiatives in which he was involved after he stepped down as Vice
Chancellor of the Open University in 1981.

    <h1> Anastasios Christodoulou </h1>
    <p> Anastasios Christodoulou (1932-2002) was the first Secretary of The
Open University and as such can be credited with designing its first
administrative systems, which enabled the new University to come into
being.
    <p> Christodoulou was born in Cyprus, the son of the village boot-maker.
His family moved to London in 1936, where his mother died in 1938. After
military service he studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford
University before becoming an overseas civil servant in Tanganyika, which
ended with the country’s independence in 1961. After a short period of
teaching and lecturing, Christodoulou moved into administration at Leeds
University, rising to Deputy Registrar. He was appointed as the first
Secretary of The Open University in 1968 and describes the process in
Lifting it off the page: an oral portrait of OU people, Ed. Tim Dagleish, 1995:
    <p> My pals at the university said I’d be nuts if I had anything to do
with it but I let my name go in. Walter Perry, the first Vice-Chancellor,
contacted me, had me up to Edinburgh, got me drunk and enthused me. I was
summoned to meet the committee, went down expecting a line of people, and
there was nobody else! They gave me a forty minute interview, then
offered me the job. I took it and never regretted it, it was fabulous,
exciting, nerve-wracking, grey-making.
    <p> Walter Perry also described the experience:
    <p> I first met Chris Christodoulou in autumn 1968, when he came to
Edinburgh to face a whole day of me explaining to him what I hoped the OU
could achieve, despite the scepticism and downright hostility of most of
the academic world. That he had the imagination and courage to accept the
post of secretary was a major victory for the project.
    <p> Four of us started work together on January 1 1969; we had two years
until we were committed to admit 25,000 students. Chris was the rock to
which I clung; I was an academic, and he provided the gifted
administrative expertise I lacked. He had absolutely no side; he talked
to everyone, and everyone talked to him. His antennae picked up word of
problems before they became serious.
    <p> While I was recruiting professors and planning teaching programmes,
Chris built a team of administrators to handle such problems as student
recruitment and records. These were common to all universities, but never
previously on such a scale - inquiries in hundreds of thousands,
applications in tens of thousands. Everything had to be computerised from
the outset, and Chris was responsible for recruiting and supervising the
people who would design the systems and make them work.
    <p> As the OU grew in size, complexity and administrative problems, Chris
found solutions. As our reputation spread, inquiries increased from
countries keen to learn about distance education. We had a steady stream
of visitors, political as well as academic, and were asked to send
delegates to countries interested in establishing their own open learning
centres. Chris played a major role in dealing with these developments.
His contribution to the OU's success was massive.
    <p> And Chris Harvie, in his obituary in the Scotsman recalls:
    <p> Big, swarthy, bespectacled – ‘a good rugby three-quarter, run to
seed’ as he once put it, Chris, after a heavy day in the pre-computer
office and on the telephone, would surface in the Walton cellar bar... It
was where things, in these days of mud, trenches, widgets that worked or
didn’t, and inexorable deadlines, tended to get sorted out. To a young,
idealistic but inexperienced staff he was always accessible, and although
Walter Perry and he exploited us ruthlessly we were, to adapt George
Orwell, ‘a family with the right members in charge’.

    <h1> Ten cheers for Jennie Lee </h1>
    <p> John Cowin
    <p> Briefly - born in London but lived formative years in Salford - left
school with a gret big zero - returned to higher education at the tender
age of 30 - at the Co-operative college - then based near Nottigham.
Discovered the true delights of study in a very encouraging environment.
My then tutor suggested that the Open University was being established
and that it might well be an ideal next stage for me.
    <p> Really did enjoy the three years of study - after what had been a
fairly lousy experience from the age of eleven (a Catholic school for
boys - complete with canings/strappings for pupils who achieved four out
of ten or less with their homework).
    <p> After leaving school I served some years as a bookbinder in Salford -
then London - moved some time later to the International Telephone
Exhange - near St Pauls - finally gave up work, as they say and started
teaching at Hornchurch technical collge - at the same time undertaking OU
studies - social sciences - arts (loved the music and history) - then a
couple of education slots. Doubtless the aforementioned years influenced
my approach to teaching (further education and from 1981 with the OU).
    <p> I remain a strong believer that understanding and support of students
can go some considerable way to building up confidence - or self belief.
    <p> Summer school experience (what wonderful years) suggested that for
some female students there had been real problems as they had struggled
to overcome doubts and often opposition from male partners - hopefully a
new generation of women are achieving AND gaining confidence in their real worth.
    <p> Many moons ago the OU employed the part-time lecturers as 'Tutor
Counsellors' and the 'TLC' element - along with encouragement I always
found to be especially rewarding. Frequently I recalled my lack of
confidence in matters academic - the (occasional) sarcasm of some
teachers and a (seemingly) over concentration on the A & B streams -
leaving the less academically gifted to struggle on.
    <p> Put another way the OU provided a massive boost -and LOTS of
enjoyment - a wonderful voyage of discovery. I have always enjoyed
teaching - at the black and later white board - but above all helping
students to enjoy learning - not to suffer  in fear of what they all too
often saw as  'failure'. Most of the technical college students could run
rings around me in their own field - engineering - electronics or motor
vehicle studies but almost all dreaded an 'invitation' - however gently
given to write down the answers !
    <p> Enough I hear you cry - thanks to everyone concerned - ten cheers at
the very least for Jennie Lee and all the many people who created the
Open University. Time was (I still recall) when some would say (and did !)
'of course you can have a real degree - or try somewhing with the OU' -
those remarks have long been silenced ...

<h1> If—, by Rudyard Kipling </h1>

<p class="verse v1">If you can keep your head when all about you
<p class="in">Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
<p> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
<p class="in">But make allowance for their doubting too;
<p> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
<p class="in">Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
<p> Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
<p class="in">And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

<p class="verse">If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
<p class="in">If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
<p> If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
<p class="in">And treat those two impostors just the same;
<p> If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
<p class="in">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
<p> Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
<p class="in">And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

<p class="verse">If you can make one heap of all your winnings
<p class="in">And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
<p> And lose, and start again at your beginnings
<p class="in">And never breathe a word about your loss;
<p> If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
<p class="in">To serve your turn long after they are gone,
<p> And so hold on when there is nothing in you
<p class="in">Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

<p class="verse">If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
<p class="in">Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
<p> If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
<p class="in">If all men count with you, but none too much;
<p> If you can fill the unforgiving minute
<p class="in">With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
<p> Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
<p class="in">And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
