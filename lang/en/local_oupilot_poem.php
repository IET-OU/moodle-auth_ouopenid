<h1> If—, by Rudyard Kipling </h1>

<p class="verse v1">If you can keep your head when all about you
<p class="in">Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
<p> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
<p class="in">But make allowance for their doubting too;
<p> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
<p class="in">Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
<p> Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
<p class="in">And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

<p class="verse">If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
<p class="in">If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
<p> If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
<p class="in">And treat those two impostors just the same;
<p> If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
<p class="in">Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
<p> Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
<p class="in">And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

<p class="verse">If you can make one heap of all your winnings
<p class="in">And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
<p> And lose, and start again at your beginnings
<p class="in">And never breathe a word about your loss;
<p> If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
<p class="in">To serve your turn long after they are gone,
<p> And so hold on when there is nothing in you
<p class="in">Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

<p class="verse">If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
<p class="in">Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
<p> If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
<p class="in">If all men count with you, but none too much;
<p> If you can fill the unforgiving minute
<p class="in">With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
<p> Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
<p class="in">And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
